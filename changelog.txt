Version 2.1.0
------------------------------------------------------

- RE-LICENSED AS MIT
- Added the much better changelog system that all my other mods use
- Fixed all crafting recipes (#48)
- Simplified fortune logic
    - It is now a base of 1 drop plus a random amount up to the fortune level.
- Added the ability to generate colors for seeds based on the first input
    - Just set your color to null or remove the value altogether
    - This change has been applied to newly created defaults
- Added info overrides
    - This system allows you to now fully customize how your seeds appear to the player
    - Example: https://streamable.com/9w5gj
    - You can now override the following things on a per-seed basis:
        - Language key to use for the items
            - This is appended by the item type (ie: seed, shard, pouch)
        - Blockstate file to use for the crop block
        - Model (and variant) to use for the Seed item
        - Model (and variant) to use for the Shard item
        - Model (and variant) to use for the Pouch item
- Added the ability to define if a seed can be fertilized (bonemeal)
- Blockstate serializer (used for defining a requirement under the soil) now takes variant strings
    - This is backwards compatible, but a warning will be logged if meta is used.
- Fixed crash when a crop provided a null key
